# Go-Kart Real-Time Controller

[![ROS2 CI Workflow](https://github.com/Triton-AI/go-kart-real-time-controller/actions/workflows/ros2-ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Triton-AI/go-kart-real-time-controller/actions/workflows/ros2-ci.yaml)

## Navigation

This repository is organized as follows:

- `ROS2` contains the gokart packet library and ROS2 driver
- `PCB` contains Altium PCB design files
- `MCU` contains microcontroller codes ([depricated, moved to a separate repository](https://github.com/Triton-AI/go-kart-real-time-controller-mbed))

## Documentations

- [Getting started with packet communication library](ROS2/src/tai_gokart_packet/design/README.md)
- [Packet API documentation](ROS2/src/tai_gokart_packet/design/Packet_API.md)
